# RNA-Protein Interaction Prediction

## **Overview**
This repository focuses on predicting RNA-Protein interactions using both **Deep Learning** and **Graph-Based Models** to compare which approach performs better for this problem. The goal is to develop an efficient and accurate computational model to analyze RNA-protein interactions, which play a critical role in cellular functions and disease mechanisms.

This is an **ongoing project**, where I am experimenting with multiple architectures and datasets to refine the predictions.

## **Project Status**
‚úÖ **Dataset Used**: [RPI1807 dataset from YuBinLab](https://github.com/YuBinLab-QUST/RPI-GGCN)  
‚úÖ **Methods Implemented**:
- Deep Learning (Transformers & Sequence-based models)
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for structured representation of interactions  
üõ† **Ongoing**:
- Evaluating performance differences between approaches  
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters  
- Exploring additional datasets like NPInter for broader generalization

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains RNA and Protein sequence pairs labeled as interacting (1) or non-interacting (0). It includes:
- **RNA sequences** (FASTA format)
- **Protein sequences** (FASTA format)
- **Interaction pairs** (CSV format with labels)

## **Approach**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning Approach**
- Used **Transformers (BERT-based embeddings)** for sequence representations
- **CNN & LSTMs** to extract features from sequence data
- **Fully Connected Neural Networks** for classification

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Graph-Based Approach**
- Constructed a bipartite graph where nodes represent **RNA and Proteins**, and edges represent interactions
- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) & Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** to model RNA-Protein connectivity
- Used PyTorch Geometric for graph-based processing
